#' This functions takes in a Seurat object with the scRNAseq data and the count matrix of the spatial transcriptomics data and returns the deconvoluted spots.
#'
#' @param se_sc Object of class Seurat with the scRNAseq data.
#' @param counts_spatial Object of class Matrix of shape GENESxSPOT, se_obj\@assays$Spatial@counts.
#' @param clust_vr Object of class character. Name of the variable containing the cell clustering.
#' @param cluster_markers Object of class dataframe obtained from the function Seurat::FindAllMarkers()
#' @param cl_n Object of class integer indicating how many cells to keep from each cluster. If a cluster has n < cl_n then all cells will be selected, if it has more then cl_n will be sampled randomly, 100 by default.
#' @param hvg Object of class numeric or NULL; Number of highly variable genes to use on top of the marker genes, if NULL then it is completely unsupervised and use top 3000 HVG.
#' @param ntop Object of class "numeric" or NULL; number of unique markers per cluster used to seed the model, by default NULL. If NULL it uses all of them.
#' @param transf Transformation to normalize the count matrix: uv (unit variance), raw (no transformation applied). By default UV.
#' @param method Object of class character; Type of method to us to find W and H. Look at NMF package for the options and specifications, by default nsNMF.
#' @param min_cont Object of class numeric; Indicates the minimum contribution we expect from a cell in that spot. Since we're working with proportions by setting 0.01, by default, means that we will accept those cell types whose weight coefficient is at least 1% of the total.
#' @param assay Object of class character; From which assay to grab the expression data to train the model, by default "RNA".
#' @param slot Object of class character; From which slot to grab the expression data to train the model, by default "counts".
#' @return This function returns a matrix with the coefficients of the spatial mixtures.
